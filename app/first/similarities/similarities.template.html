      <div class="description col-md-12">
        <p>Most of us don’t travel the whole world. Our ideas about people in other places and cultures are based on the
          images we see on tv, in movies and in advertising. The problem? Those images need to evoke some kind of
          dramatic feeling in the viewer, and so they show us the unusual and extraordinary, the horrendous or the
          amazing. Dramatic events, glorious nature and unusual cultural traditions. The consequence? People in other
          places appear to be very different from ourselves.</p>

        <p>The truth is that basic humans needs are identical across all cultures. You need a home where your family is
          safe. You need to eat, sleep, wash, play and pee. On Dollar Street it’s not the extraordinary, but the
          ordinary that fascinates. The things we all have in common. When sorting homes by income, country stereotypes
          simply fall apart. When you remove the things you "know" about other cultures, you'll find that people across
          the world live in surprisingly similar ways. By combining documentary photo and videos of homes with income
          statistics, Dollar Street can show you a view of the world based on facts, nothing else. A view that cannot be
          found anywhere else.</p>

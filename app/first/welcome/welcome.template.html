        <p>Imagine the world as a street. All houses are lined up by income, the poor living to the left and the rich to
          the right. Where would you live?And would your life look different than your neighbour's? Dollar Street lets
          you find out. And while you're exploring, we hope to change the way you look at the world. Maybe even the way
          you see yourself in it. Welcome to Dollar Street!</p>
